<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The project has been developed with expo and currently requires `expo start` to start.  Using expo a web version is available as an alternative to using a physical device (i.e.an IOS/Android phone).  Emulators are also available should physical devices be unavailable. 

Google Firebase is used as the database which can store new messages and for the messages to be retrieved.  The configuration string is created within the settings and stored with the application component.  

Google Storage is use to store picturess (blobs).
